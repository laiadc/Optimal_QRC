For both of them, we map the electronic Hamiltonian to a $n-$qubit space, and perform exact diagonalization to obtain the ground state, and the first two excited energies. The ground state will be the input to the quantum machine learning model, and the the excited energies will be the targets to be predicted by the model. "

        "It is sometimes the case that certain orbitals are very likely to be either occupied or virtual in all Slater determinants in the wave function. As calculating the ground state energy is essentially a question of distributing electrons among orbitals, we can simplify our calculation by using this information. Specifically, we are able to remove spin orbitals from the calculation if their expected occupation number is close to 0 or 1. Here, we check that the first orbital (corresponding to $a_0,a_1$) is very close to 2 and the 4rd orbital ($a_6,a_7$) is close to 0."
